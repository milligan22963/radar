Reception and Delivery of Ambient Readings

Relies on a number of projects:
POCO - https://github.com/pocoproject/poco
Paho - https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c
JSON - https://github.com/nlohmann/json

Built using CMAKE.  I will add some more details once I clean things up.  The project currently relies on a local COTS area for building which will be removed in favor of using the latest developer builds as part of the system.
